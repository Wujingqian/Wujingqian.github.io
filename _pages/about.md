My name is Jingqian Wu, a Ph.D. candidate from the Faculty of Engineering, [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Professor Edmund Y. Lam](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/) and [Professor Xihui Liu](https://xh-liu.github.io/). Before joining HKU, I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science from [Northwestern University (NU)](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a Double Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Finance from [Wake Forest University (WFU)](https://www.wfu.edu/).

My research interests lie in Computer Vision, 3D Vision, Computational Imaging, and AI. Below are some of my selected publications. You can click on the preview images to enlarge them.
